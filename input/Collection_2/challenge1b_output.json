Unlike a handwritten signature, a certificate-based signature is difficult to forge because it contains encrypted information that is unique to the signer. It can be easily verified and informs recipients whether the document was modified after the signer initially signed it. To sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a self-signed digital ID in Acrobat or Acrobat Reader.

For information on the available signing preferences, see “Signing Workflow Preferences” in the Digital Signature Guide. Customizing signature workflows using seed values Seed values offer additional control to document authors by letting them specify which choices signers can make when signing a document. By applying seed values to signature fields in unsigned PDFs, authors can customize options and automate tasks. They can also specify signature requirements for items such as certificates and timestamp servers. For more information about customizing signatures using seed values, see the Digital Signature Guide. Create the appearance of a certificate-based signature You determine the look of your certificate-based signature by selecting options in the Signatures panel of the Preferences dialog box. For example, you can include an image of your handwritten signature, a company logo, or a photograph. You can also create different signatures for different purposes. For some, you can provide a greater level of detail. A signature can also include information that helps others verify your signature , such as the reason for signing, contact information, and more. 1.
